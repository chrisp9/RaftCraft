    // TODO Although the Raft specification says that we should retry indefinitely, I'm not convnced that this is a good
    // idea. We can't just store these items in memory indefinitely, since under sufficient load we would eventually 
    // hit performance problems. A better approach may be to retry the action for a given number of times, then completely 
    // back off, clear the state and in future only send the periodic empty AppendEntriesRequests until we hear back a 
    // successful response. The main reason for the retries is to attempt to avoid packet loss from causing election timeouts. 
    // Importantly, the Raft algorithm makes no assumptions about the underlying protocol or message ordering.
    // This implementation doesn't even guarantee message ordering. Incoming messages are optimistically sent to peers, but we
    // may have many prior messages in the retry collection. We have to be optimistic - assume the delayed messages will
    // eventually received by the peer, and let the algorithm handle any state inconsistences as a result of message reordering.
    // Enforcing only one in-flight message per peer would be too slow.

    // For now though, we just retry indefinitely.
